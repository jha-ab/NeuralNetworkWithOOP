Neural Networks and Deep Learning with Object Oriented Programming




Week I - Week IV




Task 1: Create a grade A symbol using a neural network.

Task 2: Create a Multi-Layer Perceptron Object, trained and optimized the algorithm using the Gradient Descent.




Week V - Week VIII



Task 1: Use NNs to classify wine dataset. Used 4 different approaches for the same, first is a multi-layer perceptron without normalization, second uses linear normalization, third uses z-score normalization and finally used one hot encoding with categorical cross entropy loss function with adam optimizer.
